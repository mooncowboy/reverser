There are 2 NodeJS applications:

- frontend: allows the user to enter a string
- backend: exposes an api endpoint that reverses the string

Do not generate tests.
Do not use databases.
Do not use any authentication.

Use Express for both applications.
Use html, jquery and bootstrap for the frontend.

The frontend is exposed on port 3000 or the port defined in the PORT environment variable.
The backend is exposed on port 4000 or the port defined in the PORT environment variable.
